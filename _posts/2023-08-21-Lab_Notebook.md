### Brief Description:
Ran into issues with running the 'make' command, was resolved by installing pyyaml and by changing version to python3 within `convert_notebooks.py` file.

Then worked on hello world in [Java notebook]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/08/22/Java_Testing_IPYNB_2_.html), and encountered a problem with Java installation which was fixed via update.

### Progress:
1. Fixed 'make' command and can now run locally
2. Hello world in Java
3. Java Coin flipper.
