## Review:
* Created frontend and backend repositories
* Need to use nighthawk-pages instead of Svelte (???)

## To-do:
* Make Spring project assigned to Toby, AJ, Adi
* SASS customization assigned to Aiden, Ishi, Ryan, Edwin

## Backend:
* Sign in to Spotify through frontend then pass everything else through backend to Spotify API
* Discussed different methods of sign-in

## Frontend:
* Implement search feature
* Create necessary pages (sign-in)
* Stylize with SASS
