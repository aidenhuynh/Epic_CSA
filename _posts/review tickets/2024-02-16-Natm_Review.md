## T2 Focus Planning

* Test data:
    - We asked questions to people we presented to to get a better idea of what our consumers would want
        * More detail on the team blog section
* Future plans:
    - Revise wireframes and make new ones based on new features
    - Dynamic scss for colorblind settings (this was a suggested feature)
        * Should be easy because all of the main colors are done with variables, so just have a setting that switches the rgb value

## Team Blog

> A full blog for our team can be found [here](https://github.com/John-sCC/jcc_frontend/issues/42)

* Feedback Summary: We had predefined questions to ask people about UX and features
    - Relevant to me, use less of the green and blue for UI, but still make the site brighter, as its kind of dull right now
        * more vibrance
    - Colorblindness settings

## Event Blog

* CompSci Projects:
    - Ryan McWeeny and his team made a cool corn farming game, which is something we talked about back in trimester 1, so it's cool to see it coming to life.

    - I also saw many, many mario projects which were interesting as I don't know how they work. Also I thought Rachit's RIFT group had a cool concept.

* Other art:
    - In past Night at the Museums, I spent the majority of my time looking at CS projects, but this time I thought it might be nice to try and focus more on other arts
    - I saw a cool cinematography reel from Brooke Rosenberg, which I felt like making note of because I am the president of the Cinema Production club and its relevant or something

    - I also saw Duncan Engel's set design for Little Shop of Horrors, which wasn't used unfortunately but the set design still is really cool
