### Reflection
The main takeaway I got from this set of student lessons is the usefulness of certain libraries and the use of other resources to simplify coding. For example, jQuery can simplify the process of coding in JavaScript and HTML, and Thymeleaf can make testing backend-to-frontend interactions easier. However, I would have liked to learn more about CORS, because this caused us an insane amount of issues when working with Flask last year in CSP.

## Past Projects/Accomplishments

### Classroom Jukebox
This is my favorite project that I've done in CS, as I feel like it actually has potential to be a usable product in the future. It essentially allows teachers to host rooms linked to their spotify accounts, then lets students connect to this room and suggest songs to be played on the teacher's account. My main contributions were integrated the Spotify API methods into the frontend as well as designing and creating the user interface. I will continue working on this eventually.

### Sorting Mini-Project
This project was not great for me because I couldn't find a way to make it interesting so it ended up just being the most basic sorting website imaginable. At least it works? My main contributions were the user interface (again), functionality of the frontend, and I made half of the sorting algorithms used (6/12).

## Current Project

### Planning

1. We started planning with a team meeting, in which we decided to follow an engineering process and find a problem to solve so that we knew we would be making something actually impactful
2. Made a plan for teachers to interview, then took notes after some interviews
    - All on [this document](https://john-scc.github.io/jcc_frontend/2023/12/18/teachersurvey.html)

3. Had another standing meeting to finalize planning
    - [Link to notes](https://github.com/John-sCC/jcc_frontend/issues/4)
4. Decided on making a teacher resource website with table randomizers, stats visualizers, etc. to be able to satisfy the needs of the most teachers possible

### Personal Note
I am very excited to make this project because it seems that certain teachers will really benefit from this, such as the stats teachers because of the statistics section we are planning to make on our teacher resource website
