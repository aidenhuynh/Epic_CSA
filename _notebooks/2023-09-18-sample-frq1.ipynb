    "- `public class Data { ... }`: The `Data` class is defined. It encapsulates functionality related to a 2D grid of integers. The class includes the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `public static final int MAX = 100;`: A constant integer named `MAX` is declared with a value of `100`. This constant is marked as `static` and `final`, making it a class-level constant that cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `private int[][] grid;`: An instance variable `grid` is declared as a 2D array of integers. This variable is private, meaning it can only be accessed within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `public void repopulate(int rows, int columns) { ... }`: This method is responsible for filling the `grid` with random numbers that meet specific criteria. It takes `rows` and `columns` as arguments to determine the size of the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `public Data(int rows, int columns) { ... }`: The constructor of the class. It initializes a new `Data` object by calling the `repopulate` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `public int countIncreasingCols() { ... }`: This method calculates the number of columns in `grid` that have values in increasing order. It iterates through each column and checks if the values in the column are in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `public int[][] getter() { ... }`: A getter method that allows external classes to access the `grid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `public static void main(String[] args) { ... }`: The main method is defined. It serves as a test harness for the `Data` class. It creates a new `Data` object, prints out the grid, and counts the number of increasing columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Data.main(null)`: A call to the `main` method, which starts the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this Java code defines a class (`Data`) for managing a 2D grid of integers. It provides methods for populating the grid with random numbers, counting the number of increasing columns, and retrieving the grid itself. The `main` method serves as a test harness for the class.\n"

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "**The Java code** effectively utilizes the `Random` class for generating random integers. The `Data` class, with its constant `MAX` set to 100, dynamically creates a 2D array based on provided parameters. Noteworthy is the `repopulate` method, where random numbers are generated, adhering to specific criteria such as divisibility by 10 and non-divisibility by 100. The `countIncreasingCols` method intelligently analyzes column order, employing nested loops for precise evaluation. Moreover, the code emphasizes the value of informed assumptions, exemplified by the `MAX` constant, streamlining complex scenarios. This approach, coupled with methodical problem analysis, lays a robust foundation for effective code development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumuming values can help solve these problems ans also creating tester methods and constant checking can also help solve these problems. I missed alot of \";\" which became better."
